# WebApps 2013

  
## TODO

 - Set-up Database {Postgres Set-up successfully}  

 - Server side code to get commands from network to serve DB  
    - Linking Postgres {pgAdminIII, as all have elected to run this program} with PHP
    - Suggestion: Two people can work on this whilst two people start with app UI?

 - every request from app needs ID in it  
    - hash request with hash of user password  

 - Client-side code:  
    - junk data in DB to test app drawing  
    - networking code on iPad also  

Current Plan:  
Postgres DB as provided by CSG + PHP server  
{self-hosted -> intergration with DoC will come later if required}
