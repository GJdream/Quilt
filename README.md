# WebApps 2013

  
## TODO

 - Set-up Database {Complete}  
 - Server side code to get commands from network to serve DB  
    - Link DB with PHP {Complete}
    - Need to be able to listen on network and return requested data
      - Fill DB with junk data for testing throughout 

 - every request from app needs ID in it  
    - hash request with hash of user password
      - NOTE: DB is currently successfully registering current user_name column as PRIMARY KEY

 - Client-side code:  
    - junk data in DB to test app drawing  
    - networking code on iPad also  

  
  
#### Current Plan:  
Postgres DB as provided by CSG + PHP server  
{self-hosted -> intergration with DoC will come later if required}
