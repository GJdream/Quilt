# WebApps 2013

  
## TODO

 - Set-up Database  
    - Server side code to get commands from network to serve DB  

 - every request from app needs ID in it  
    - hash request with hash of user password  

 - Client-side code:  
    - junk data in DB to test app drawing  
    - networking code on iPad also  

Current Plan:  
Postgres DB as provided by CSG + PHP server {self-hosted -> intergration with DoC will come later if required}
